- Need to get eta → mu mu .dec file
- For now, start with eta → mu mu gamma MC data
- Once you have dec file, look for it in Bookkeeping
- eta → mu mu gamma file: 39112230 (2018 MC)
- Stripping: 40 MHz (40 mil/s) pp collisions, trigger to make quick selection, e.g. mu mu detection at muon chamber rare so we keep it
- L0 trigger (single e-, gamme, hadron, muon with high momentum) (dimuon)
- HLT 1-2 sotware, more sophisticated, reconstruction of transverse momentum, then write to disk, muon muon events data still *a lot* and inefficient, so we break it up
	- Lepton streams (high pT leptons)
	- QEE streams (high pT)
- Stripping lines associated with triggers, looser requirements; set parameters for data be split into streams, making it easier to work with and accessing only what you probably need
- Why are we building RPCs? **Answer:** spatial and tie resolution considerations + cost
- CERN library for whatever particle detector books needed
- **1 day/wk analysis, 1 day/wk learning stuff, 3 days/wk CODEX**
	- Once the CODEX push ends in the next 3 months or so, move towards a schedule like this
