- Why does symmetry breaking tell us anything? 
	- **Answer:** symmetry comes from conservation. If we observe symmetry breaking then we know there is some violation occurring or approximation in our models. If we confine things to conserve energy, we expect some symmetry from input to output. This is what allows us to find errors in our model.
- Schwartz is going to ask me about PMTs and the difference between all the other components. Coupled to this, he will ask why we use different detectors and detection methods in a detector? Why not just have layers of the same thing?
- Read the book Schwartz emailed you to read. It talks about the foundations of detectors and the why of everything that every paper is built upon.
